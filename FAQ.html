        <div class="faq-question">What is this website?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Cosmic Calm is a space-themed mental health website, where each
          illness is represented by a unique planet. Our goal is to increase
          awareness of mental health through visuals, research, and
          interactivity.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What are some main functionalities?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Our website has interactive, fictional planets that represent
          different mental disorders. Users can explore information, take a
          quiz, and listen to carefully selected music. <br />
          <br />
          Mental disorders are often generalized as negative, so our website
          combats that idea and provides users with a place where they can feel
          seen. <br />
          <br />

          Additionally, we’ve implemented a custom cursor that changes when
          hovering over interactive items. In case a user isn’t sure if they can
          click on something, they can check the cursor.
        </div>

          What is the problem we are trying to solve and why?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Mental health is often misunderstood, stigmatized, or reduced to
          clinical terms, which makes it hard to emotionally connect with. We
          wanted to create a bridge between abstract struggles and tangible
          understanding.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What idea are we excited to explore?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          What if mental illnesses were planets, each with their own ecosystems,
          weather, and lore? By turning psychological experiences into immersive
          worlds, we make them easier to explore, discuss, and empathize with.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What inspired us to start this project?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          We kicked things off by focusing on what united us: a shared interest
          of mental health awareness. Our goal was to help users feel understood
          and seen. After brainstorming, we decided on a website that used
          metaphors to convey how it feels to experience various disorders.
          <br />
          <br />Finally, here we are, presenting our work! We're extremely
          excited about getting to make a difference in the battle of mental
          health.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">
          What makes this meaningful or important to us?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          This matters to us because everyone deserves to feel seen. If users
          can walk away from this experience with something memorable, we’ve
          turned isolation into connection.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Who might use our product?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Teens & young adults (ages 15–30) exploring mental health, plus
          educators/therapists seeking creative tools. Gamers, sci-fi fans, and
          art-driven learners will love the format.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What problem can our website solve?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Mental health can feel isolating or hard to articulate. Our "planets"
          turn abstract struggles into immersive, relatable worlds, making
          self-reflection feel more like exploration than therapy.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What were some challenges along the way?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          While creating the quiz page, it took several tries to make the
          autocheck algorithm work properly. As soon as the results were
          outputted onto the webpage, the form immediately refreshed, clearing
          the feedback. After reviewing the code, we realized that the
          “resultsDiv.innerHTML” line was inside the for loop, so we took it
          out. <br />
          <br />
          Another problem that arose was related to the custom cursor. It didn’t
          appear on some pages, so we individually pasted the code onto all of
          the webpages. <br />
          <br />
          There were also CSS issues with designing and arranging elements, like
          buttons and images. We had to go through a lot of trial and error in
          order to get to our ideal final product.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <ul>
            <li>For fun: Curiosity-driven exploration (like a game).</li>
            <li>
              For learning: Teachers/therapists using it to spark discussions.
            </li>
            <li>
              For self-discovery: Someone thinking, "Wait, does my brain feel
              like this stormy planet?"
            </li>

        <div class="faq-question">Who do we hope this product will impact?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Anyone who’s ever felt alone in their struggles. By framing mental
          health as a universe to explore, not just a problem to fix. We help
          users feel seen, not misunderstood.

          What were our main takeaways from this project?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <li>
            Mental health is a sensitive topic. However, this only makes honest
            and open discussions about it even more important, and they can also
            be approached in engaging and creative ways.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Constant reflecting and research is key while developing and
            improving a project.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            A lot of trial and error is needed in the web development process.
            No one can succeed in everything from the get-go.
